| insufficient information on encoding image | [code is provided](https://github.com/reubenharry/Recurrent-RSA) |
| human evaluation using Amazon Mechanical Turk | automatic evaluation: production and evaluation models trained on separate sets (?) |

can we get away with not having human evaluation for Andreas & Klein (2016): No considering fig 5n etc. <br>
acting as human rater means we two have to rate all the results $:)$

What to do with Cohn-Gordon et al:
- try to understand their paper and code
- reproduce
- control experiment with beam search for both, and greedy for both char and word
